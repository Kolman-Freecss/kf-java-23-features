# Java 23 Features Exploration

This project is designed to test and learn the new features introduced in Java 23. Below is an overview of the features covered:

## Features
1. **Strings**
   - Text Blocks
   - `String` templates

## How to Run
- To run the project, use the following command:
  ```bash
  mvn clean compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.kolmanfreecss.Main


## Passive skills 

### Garbage Collection and JVM
- Improved ZGC Performance:
  - Better adaptability for heap resizing and object relocation.
- Class Data Sharing (CDS):
  - Further optimizations in shared memory regions to reduce startup times.

### Small Quality of Life Improvements
